BLUESJAMTRACKS.COM -- HOW TO USE THIS PACKAGE

All filenames (mp3, pdf, powertab) follow a clear pattern... the abbreviation for the name of the album, followed by the player's name. For instance "cb_aking.mp3" is the Albert King track from the Classic Blues album.

Similarly, "cb_aking_jt.mp3" is the equivalent jam track. The two transcription files will then be "cb_aking.pdf" and "cb_aking.ptb". All of our files follow this pattern.

For best results, load all of the audio files into an mp3 player such as iTunes or Winamp. That way, you'll see all of the artist/album/track information from the ID3 tags, which look a lot better than the filenames!

If you've bought one of the new packages with videos, those are the files ending in ".mp4", and they'll play in iTunes, Quicktime, VLC or Windows Media Player.

We hope you enjoy the package!
